    The VxEngine Project (https://github.com/skarpenko/vxengine)


VxEngine is a lightweight vector engine which accelerates dot product vector
operation. Due to scalable design it can be used in various IoT-class devices.


PREREQUISITES

  Here is the list of prerequisites required to play with VxEngine:

  * FPGA design software. For example, Intel Quartus or Xilinx Vivado. It is
    required for synthesizing VxEngine for FPGA. Check corresponding websites
    for recent versions.

  * Icarus Verilog v10.0 (http://iverilog.icarus.com/). Verilog simulation
    tool which is used for running RTL simulation of VxEngine and verification
    testbenches of its components.

  * Verilator v3.874 (https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/). Verilator
    converts synthesizable Verilog code into C++ or SystemC code. It is required
    for building VxEngine system model and verification testbenches for its
    components.

  * GTK Wave (http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/). GTK+ based wave viewer
    which could be used for waveforms visualization.
